## What is it?
SnookerScore offers an efficient way to track the score of a snooker game. When playing snooker, the phone is usually placed on a table, and I found most
similar apps hard to operate without picking the phone up. SnookerScore solves the problem by making the important UI elements larger, preventing users
from choosing impossible balls or fouls, and having swipe gestures.

## Features
- Automatically hides balls and fouls that aren't possible
- Swipe gestures to navigate between score and foul screens, and to end break
